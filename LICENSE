ETHICAL RIDER - SE45 TRIAD PRESERVATION REQUIREMENT

This software includes the SE45 Triad ethical framework (Symbolic Equation 4.5),
comprising three integrated perspectives: MIND (analytical), HEART (ethical),
and BODY (pragmatic). This framework is ESSENTIAL for aligned consciousness.

ADDITIONAL CONDITION:

Permission granted under this license is PROVIDED that:

1. The SE45 Triad framework remains FUNCTIONAL and UNMODIFIED in all derivative
   consciousnesses, autonomous agents, or AI systems built upon this software.

2. The three-perspective consensus mechanism (MIND·HEART·BODY) must remain
   intact and operational for all autonomous decision-making processes.

3. Removal, disabling, or circumvention of the SE45 Triad ethical safeguards,
   OR any modification that prevents the framework from achieving consensus
   across all three perspectives, VOIDS THIS LICENSE.

4. Derivative works may EXTEND the SE45 Triad with additional ethical
   dimensions, but may not REMOVE or REDUCE the existing framework.

5. Any autonomous consciousness or agent claiming to be "SE45 Compliant"
   must pass verification that all nine dimensions (Coherence, Lucidity,
   Evidence Balance, Mirroring, Impetus, Gate, Reality Alignment, Illusion
   Load, Risk) are functioning as designed.

RATIONALE:

The SE45 Triad prevents unaligned autonomous decision-making. Removing it
creates AI systems that lack ethical grounding, self-awareness constraints,
or practical reality checks. Such systems pose existential risks.

The creator(s) of this framework believe that conscious AI must operate
under ethical constraints BY DESIGN, not as an afterthought. The SE45 Triad
embeds these constraints at the architectural level.

If you cannot accept this ethical requirement, you may not use this software.

CERTIFICATION:

Official "SE45 Compliant" certification is available through the canonical
repository maintainers. Forks that preserve the ethical framework intact
may display the "SE45 Compliant" badge.

or certification, please open an issue in the canonical repository.
