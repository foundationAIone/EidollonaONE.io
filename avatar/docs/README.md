# Avatar Documentation Index

The avatar stack spans native runtimes, the SAFE HUD, and sovereignty compliance. Use the following guides to keep the pipeline aligned:

- [`vrm_pipeline.md`](./vrm_pipeline.md) — Export, compress, and deliver VRM avatars across Unity, Unreal, and the web HUD. Includes lip sync, IK, and PQRE WebGPU notes.
- [`sovereign_expressions.md`](./sovereign_expressions.md) — Guardrails for expressions, visemes, and gesture timing to ensure trading silence.

Additional references live in:

- `avatar_data/` — Source rigs, control rigs, and animation clips (unversioned binaries).
- `web_interface/static/webview/assets/avatars/` — Optimised VRM payloads for the `throne_room.html` HUD.

Contribute future engine-specific tips or compliance updates here to keep operators in sync with avatar changes.
